# Outline
### How I plan for this project to go
## The Info
- Analyze Boston Datasets
- Ecomonic Indicators vs Occurences of Crime
- Public CSVs: No Web-Scraper needed
## The Process
- Load Both Datasets into MySQL
- Group crime data by type
- Refine and Aggregate crime data to match granularity of Economic Indicators
  - Add columns for start date and end date to represent the target span of the month/year
  - Final output should be aggregated by month/year, grouped by type
## The Analysis
- Can we predict crime rates based on key economic performance indicators
- Chart the timelines of various indicators as series 
- Overlay with occurrences of criminal activity
